# Connect4Web

This repo contains the code nessesary to run the API that supports the connect4game hosted at the repo https://github.com/StephenMistele/Connect4WebUI, or live at https://connect4.stephenmistele.com. To run this project locally, make sure you have node installed, then navigate to the project directory and run npm install, followed by npm start.

With the API now running, you can manually hit the controllers to simulate gameplay with a tool like postman, or spool up the before mentioned Connect4WebUI repo, point it to localhost:3000, and mess around.
